        <h3>By: Cesar Garcia</h3>
        <p>This trivia game is like no other, here you will be quizzed on so many different topics your head will explode (once you click the button, we are not legally responsible for any head explosions). You will have a list of topics and a difficulty level to choose from, so choose wisely. Depending on the difficulty level your time will increase, you also have a one hint per question if you brain cannot handle the complexity of the question. Hope you enjoy!</p>
